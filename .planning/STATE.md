# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-17)

**Core value:** Every requirement in the challenge PDF is met to the letter and is provable in
under five minutes by an evaluator: `docker compose up`, run the tests, read the docs.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Quality Gates

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation & Quality Gates)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Python 3.13, `src/taskmanager/` layout, psycopg 3 + SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Alembic
- [Roadmap]: Domain entities as stdlib dataclasses; Pydantic at schema/DTO/settings boundaries
- [Roadmap]: RFC 9457 problem+json from a single exception handler, built before any router
- [Roadmap]: 404 for invisible resources, 403 for visible-but-forbidden
- [Roadmap]: Completion % over the whole list via one SQL aggregate; pytest-asyncio loop scope
  `function` by default; `postgres:18-alpine`

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 3 (async session lifecycle, transactional test fixtures, Alembic `env.py`) and Phase 5
  (JWT/hashing libraries, 403-vs-404 matrix) are flagged by research as needing
  `/gsd:plan-phase --research-phase`.

- `AI_WORKFLOW.md` must be appended to at the end of every phase; reconstructing it in Phase 7
  would undermine the project's own thesis.
